# Hotel analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for cleaning and analyzing the hotel bookings demand dataset, which is available <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand>here</a>. The Kaggle API was used to automate the download process, thus making the overall code more flexible as it does not depend on the dataset being already present in order to work.
